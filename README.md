This project leverages the power of machine learning to accurately detect diseases based on patient-provided descriptions of symptoms. Once a disease is identified, the system provides relevant medication suggestions.

Key Features:

 - Natural Language Processing (NLP): Processes and understands patient-provided text descriptions.  
 - Machine Learning Models: Employs advanced machine learning algorithms to classify diseases. 
 - Medication Recommendation System: Suggests appropriate medications based on the diagnosed disease.
 - User-Friendly Interface: Provides a simple and intuitive interface for users to input their symptoms.


 * Technical Details:

Data: The project utilizes a dataset of patient records, including symptoms and corresponding diagnoses.
Preprocessing: Text preprocessing techniques are applied to clean and normalize the input text.
Model Training: Machine learning models, such as Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forest, or Neural Networks, are trained on the preprocessed data.
Prediction: The trained model is used to predict the most likely disease based on the user's input symptoms.
Medication Recommendation: A knowledge base of diseases and their associated medications is used to suggest appropriate treatments.
