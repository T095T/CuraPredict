# CuraPredict - Disease Detection and Medication Recommendation System

This project leverages the power of machine learning to accurately detect diseases based on patient-provided descriptions of symptoms. Once a disease is identified, the system provides relevant medication suggestions.

## Key Features

- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: Processes and understands patient-provided text descriptions to identify relevant symptoms.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Employs advanced machine learning algorithms to classify diseases accurately.
- **Medication Recommendation System**: Suggests appropriate medications based on the diagnosed disease.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Offers a simple and intuitive interface for users to input their symptoms.

## Technical Details

### Data
- Utilizes a dataset of patient records, including symptoms and corresponding diagnoses.

### Preprocessing
- Applies text preprocessing techniques (e.g., tokenization, stopword removal, stemming) to clean and normalize the input text.

### Model Training
- Trains machine learning models such as Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forest, or Neural Networks on the preprocessed data for disease classification.

### Prediction
- Uses the trained model to predict the most likely disease based on user-provided symptoms.

### Medication Recommendation
- References a knowledge base of diseases and their associated medications to suggest appropriate treatments.

## Future Work
- Enhance the model's accuracy with a larger dataset.
- Incorporate more advanced NLP techniques to improve symptom understanding.
- Expand the medication recommendation system with additional data sources and real-time updates.
